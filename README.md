# myPorteusDocs.github.io

This is planned as an opinionated documentation of [Porteus Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porteus_(operating_system)) or documentation of an opinionated usage of Porteus, where "opinionated" is short for "some parameters fixed".

The goal is less to promote opinions, but to get things clear.

Note that this is not an official project of Porteus, but it aims to promote Porteus.
